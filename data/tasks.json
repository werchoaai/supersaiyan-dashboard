  "claudeReviewMd": "# CLAUDE REVIEW\n\n- Task ID: `20260222-235418-dual-agent-first-live-task`\n- Reviewer: `Claude Code`\n- Updated (UTC): `2026-02-23T06:00:00Z`\n\n## Summary\n\nArchitecture review of the SuperSaiyan dual-agent coordination system. The infrastructure is well-designed \u2014 clean file-based state machine, good observability, proper locking. Several concrete issues found below.\n\n## Findings (Highest Severity First)\n\n1. [BLOCKER] `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/coord:62-74` \u2014 `render_template` is vulnerable to sed injection. The `$title` variable is interpolated directly into a `sed` substitution pattern (`s/__TITLE__/${title}/g`). If a task title contains `/`, `&`, `\\`, or newlines, sed will fail or produce corrupted output. This will break task creation for any non-trivial title.\n   - **Fix**: Escape sed special characters in all variables before substitution.\n\n2. [MEDIUM] `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/supersaiyan_turn.sh:142` \u2014 Claude is invoked with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`. This grants unrestricted command execution to an autonomous agent. Acceptable for a personal machine, but should be documented as a conscious security trade-off in the manual.\n\n3. [MEDIUM] `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/supersaiyan_daemon_stop.sh:15` \u2014 Stopping the daemon kills only the parent shell loop, not child `claude` or `codex` processes spawned by `supersaiyan_turn.sh`. Orphaned child processes will continue running and the lock directory may become stale.\n   - **Fix**: Kill the process group (`kill -- -\"${PID}\"`) and start the daemon with `setsid` so it gets its own process group.\n\n4. [LOW] `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/coord:207` \u2014 `ls -1` output is not reliable for programmatic empty-directory checks.\n\n5. [LOW] No validation on `COORD_FROM_AGENT` env var (`coord:178`). Values with `|` or newlines corrupt log format.\n\n6. [LOW] Daemon poll interval defaults to 20s. If both agents complete quickly, turns chain rapidly. Consider a per-turn cooldown.\n\n## Risks\n\n- **Orphaned processes**: Autopilot stop doesn't kill children; a `claude` or `codex` process could run indefinitely without coordination.\n- **Title injection**: Real-world titles like \"fix foo/bar path\" or \"update A & B\" will hit the sed bug immediately.\n- **Bypass permissions escalation**: If this system moves to a shared machine or CI, `bypassPermissions` becomes a real security hole.\n\n## Design Opinion\n\n- Preferred approach: File-based async state machine is the right design. Inspectable, debuggable, works across terminals.\n- Rejected alternatives: WebSocket/IPC between agents \u2014 adds complexity without benefit at this scale.\n- Why: Simplicity wins for a two-agent system on a single machine. Architecture is production-grade for its scope.\n\n## Required Changes Before Close\n\n1. [BLOCKER] Fix `render_template` sed injection in `coord:62-74` \u2014 escape all template variables.\n2. [MEDIUM] Fix daemon stop to kill child processes (process group kill).\n3. [MEDIUM] Add security note about `bypassPermissions` to the manual.\n4. [LOW] Fill in TASK.md objective/acceptance criteria retroactively.\n\n## Verification Requested\n\n- Tests to run:\n  - Create a task with special characters: `supersaiyan start \"fix foo/bar & baz\"` \u2014 should not fail.\n  - Start and stop autopilot; verify no orphaned processes: `ps aux | grep -E 'claude|codex'`\n- Expected outputs:\n  - Clean task creation with special chars preserved in TASK.md\n  - No orphaned processes after autopilot stop\n",
  "codexImplMd": "# CODEX IMPLEMENTATION\n\n- Task ID: `20260222-235418-dual-agent-first-live-task`\n- Implementer: `Codex`\n- Updated (UTC): `2026-02-23T01:26:54Z`\n\n## Plan\n\n1. Apply blocker fix in `scripts/coord` so template substitution is safe for special characters in task titles.\n2. Fix daemon start/stop process lifecycle so autopilot stop targets the daemon process group (and children) when isolated launch is available.\n3. Document the Claude `bypassPermissions` trade-off and backfill task metadata (`TASK.md`), then run verification and handoff.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n- File: `scripts/coord`\n  - What changed: added `escape_sed_replacement` and used escaped replacements in `render_template`; switched sed delimiter to `|`; sanitized `COORD_FROM_AGENT` via `sanitize_agent_id`; hardened empty-task listing check using `nullglob` array.\n  - Why: fixes title/template sed injection/corruption blocker and hardens log formatting/list behavior.\n- File: `scripts/supersaiyan_daemon_start.sh`\n  - What changed: daemon now launches in isolated session/process-group when possible (`setsid` or `python3` `os.setsid()` fallback), and writes both PID + PGID into pid file.\n  - Why: enables reliable process-group stop behavior and child cleanup.\n- File: `scripts/supersaiyan_daemon_stop.sh`\n  - What changed: stop path now kills process group when pidfile PGID is present and matches PID; falls back to PID kill otherwise; applies SIGKILL fallback similarly.\n  - Why: prevents child/orphan turn processes when daemon is isolated.\n- File: `coordination/SUPERSAIYAN_FULL_MANUAL.md`\n  - What changed: added explicit security section documenting `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` trade-off and safe-use boundaries.\n  - Why: required medium-severity doc change from review.\n- File: `coordination/tasks/20260222-235418-dual-agent-first-live-task/TASK.md`\n  - What changed: filled Objective, Scope, Constraints, Acceptance Criteria, and References.\n  - Why: closes required task-record completeness gap from review.\n- File: `BOOTSTRAP.md` (deleted)\n  - What changed: removed after reading/processing per workspace first-run instruction.\n  - Why: aligns workspace policy from `AGENTS.md`.\n\n## Commands Run\n\n```bash\nbash -n scripts/coord\nbash -n scripts/supersaiyan_daemon_start.sh\nbash -n scripts/supersaiyan_daemon_stop.sh\n# result: syntax checks passed\n\nscripts/coord new-task \"fix foo/bar & baz\" codex-test\ngrep -n \"^# TASK:\" coordination/tasks/20260223-012345-fix-foo-bar-baz/TASK.md\ngrep -n \"fix foo/bar & baz\" coordination/tasks/20260223-012345-fix-foo-bar-baz/TASK.md\n# result: task created successfully; special chars preserved in generated TASK.md\n\nscripts/supersaiyan_daemon_start.sh\nscripts/supersaiyan_daemon_stop.sh\n# result: start/stop successful with pid+pgid logging\n\nscripts/supersaiyan autopilot-start\nscripts/supersaiyan autopilot-stop\n# result: wrapper start/stop both returned rc=0\n\nkill -0 <pid-before-stop>\nkill -0 -- -<pgid-before-stop>\n# result: both checks failed after stop (daemon pid and process group not alive)\n\nps aux | grep -E 'claude|codex'\npgrep -fl '...'\n# result: process listing blocked in this environment (`operation not permitted` / `Cannot get process list`), so liveness was verified with kill -0 checks instead.\n```\n\n## Test Evidence\n\n- Test: Template escaping with special characters\n- Result: PASS\n- Notes: `scripts/coord new-task \"fix foo/bar & baz\"` created `20260223-012345-fix-foo-bar-baz`; generated `TASK.md` contains exact title `fix foo/bar & baz`.\n\n- Test: Daemon lifecycle / process-group stop\n- Result: PASS\n- Notes: run produced `pid=54938, pgid=54938`; before stop `kill -0 54938` succeeded; after stop both `kill -0 54938` and `kill -0 -- -54938` failed.\n\n- Test: Wrapper command path\n- Result: PASS\n- Notes: `scripts/supersaiyan autopilot-start` and `scripts/supersaiyan autopilot-stop` both returned zero; stop reported `SuperSaiyan daemon stopped (pid=..., pgid=...)`.\n\n## Open Items\n\n- Claude re-review still required before close (expected next step in this task workflow).\n",
